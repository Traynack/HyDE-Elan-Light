# Installation
This is apart of a larger theme that requires more configuration than what is currently possible with HyDE themes. (I am *probably* wrong about this, so if anyone knows of a better way of doing this, please let me know.) See [Élan Flower](https://github.com/Traynack/Elan-Flower) for more details.
